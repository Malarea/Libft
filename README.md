Libft
Description
Libft is a custom implementation of several standard C library functions. Developed as part of the Ã‰cole 42 curriculum, this project serves as the foundation for other 42 projects. It includes implementations for string manipulation, memory management, linked lists, and other utility functions commonly used in C programming. The goal was to deepen my understanding of basic algorithms, pointer manipulation, and efficient memory handling.

Features
String Functions: Custom versions of functions like strcpy, strdup, strcat, strchr, etc.
Memory Management: Functions for memory allocation, initialization, and copying like malloc, memset, memcpy, etc.
Linked Lists: Basic operations on singly linked lists such as creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal.
Additional Utility Functions: Implementations of useful algorithms like atoi, itoa, isalpha, isdigit, etc.
